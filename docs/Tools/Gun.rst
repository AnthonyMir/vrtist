| The gun tool is used to shoot objects with physics into the scene. 
| Select one or multiple objects in the asset list to add them to the gun. 
| Use the slider to define fire rate, power and scale. Use the secondary controller trigger to fire the objects from the secondary controller. If multiple objects are added to the gun, they will be fired one by one in the selected order.
