Controllers
-----------

The primary controller is exclusively used for the palette, the secondary controller is used for tools and scene interaction. Current active tool is shown by the mouthpiece on the secondary controller.

By default, the primary controller is left, and secondary is right.

The controllers have some basic inputs.
The two buttons on the primary controller are used to undo or redo the last command.
The two buttons on the secondary controller are used to duplicate the selected item, and quickly switch tools. The tools switch between selection (blue mouthpiece), deletion (red mouthpiece) and the last used tool (tool’s mouthpiece).

Primary and secondary controllers can be switched in the user settings.
