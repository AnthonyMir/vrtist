# VRtist

VR scene exploration and set dressing.

## How to install

### Install VRtist

- Build the Main scene in Unity Editor
- Copy the VRtist folder in any location you want (Here we will use the path d:/vrtist)

Right now VRtist can't load or save any scene as a standalone software so the use of Blender & Mixer are required.

### Install Blender

Download Blender 2.83 or above from blender.org (either install version or portable version).

### Install Mixer

VRtist uses Mixer to get the content of a Blender scene and to synchronize it with Unity.

see: https://github.com/ubisoft/mixer/README.md

Mixer is a standard Blender addon. Install it like any other addon.

- Go to Edit > Preferences > Add-ons
- Click the install... button and search "mixer.zip"
- Activate the add-on by checking the "Collaboration Mixer" item

## How to launch

Open your scene in Blender. In 3D Viewport, press "N" to open the Mixer addon. Ener the VRtist.exe path.

Launch or join a server, create or join a room and press "Launch VRtist". Put your headset and enjoy!

A Windows firewall popup may appear during the first launch, accept it.

When done, everything that you did in VRtist is in your Blender scene. You can continue to work on it and relaunch VRtist anytime you want.
